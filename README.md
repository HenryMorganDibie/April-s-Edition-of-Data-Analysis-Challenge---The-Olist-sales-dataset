* Several datasets were used, including customers, geolocation, order items, order payments, order reviews, orders, products, sellers, and product category name translation.
* The data was loaded into Python using the Pandas library.
* The data was cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, merge relevant columns, and convert data types as needed.
* Exploratory data analysis was conducted to gain insights into the data, including understanding the distribution of sales, ratings, and reviews, the top-selling products and categories, and the demographics of customers and sellers.
* Visualizations were used to represent the data in a meaningful way, including bar plots, pie charts, and scatter plots.
* Further analysis was conducted to understand the relationship between customer reviews and product performance, as well as the number of active sellers on Olist and how it changed over time.
